# mirrorcam

A small simple app for showing the camera feed, without any UI. 

Works well with [Vysor.io](https://www.vysor.io/) & its camera plugin as a **webcam for your computer!**

Here are the steps:
1) Download and install [Vysor.io](https://www.vysor.io/)
2) Run Vysor and enable the camera plugin
3) In Vysor, activate the device that you want to use as your webcam (requires adb access)
4) Open the Mirrorcam application
5) When you're in Zoom, Google Meets, etc., simply select Vysor as the camera feed!
